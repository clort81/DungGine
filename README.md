# DungGine

`DungGineÂ´ is a terminal based dungeon engine for RPGs and Rogue-likes and that uses [`Termin8or`](https://github.com/razterizer/Termin8or) for rendering.
This is a header only library.
The engine works very well together with the `GameEngine` class of lib [`Termin8or`](https://github.com/razterizer/Termin8or).

This library is very new and currently only provides a class `BSPTree` that is responsible for creating the rooms in the "dungeon".

## Headers

* `BSPTree.h`
  - `generate()` : Generates the BSP regions recursively.
  - `pad_rooms()` : Pads the regions into rooms.
  - `create_corridors()` : Creates corridors. **Warning: Not working properly yet**.
  - `draw_regions()` : Draws the regions.
  - `draw_rooms()` : Draws the rooms.
  - `draw_corridors()` : Draws the corridors.
  - `print_tree()` : Debug printing of the tree.

## Examples
