# DungGine

DungGine is a terminal based dungeon engine for RPGs and Rogue-likes and that uses Termin8or for rendering.
This is a header only library.
The engine works very well together with the GameEngine class of lib Termin8or.

This library is very new and currently only provides a class BSPTree that is responsible for creating the rooms in the "dungeon".
